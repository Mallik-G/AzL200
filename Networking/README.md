# Azure Networking Lab

This lab should take around 15-20 minutes and contains all the steps you need to perform.
All you need to do is change a few variables to be unique

# Steps

## Step 1 - Azure Cloud Shell
Log in to Azure Portal and open the Cloud Shell.
If this is the first time you are doing this it will prompt you to create a Cloud Drive to store your profile and files. Using the defaults should be fine.
Create a folder in the CloudDrive to store your files for this lab and keep them separate from other things.
All of the Azure CLI commands are located in the AzureNetworking101.azcli file in this directory.
This can be opened in VS Code and the Azure CLI Tools extension will colourise it
